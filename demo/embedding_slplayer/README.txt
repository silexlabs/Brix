This demo intends to show how to embed an SLPlayer application to an existing application. Embedding several SLPlayer applications within the same application without class conflict is also possible. Here the folders src_slplayer_01 and src_slplayer_02 are two source folders of two different SLPlayer applications.

To run this demo: 
	
Set a proper environment : download cocktail, set the right path to the cocktail lib in the build_js.hxml and build_as3.hxml files of both slplayer applications.

Compile the both applications (folder src_slplayer_01 and src_slplayer_02) for flash and for js. Compile also the parent flash application (src_as3/build.hxml).

Test it by opening output.html and output.swf in a web browser.
