To run this demo: 

First, simply configure an alias in your Apache conf like this one :
	
	Alias /slplayer/ "E:/PATH_TO_MY_FILES/slplayer_repository/" 

	<Directory "E:/PATH_TO_MY_FILES/slplayer_repository/">
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		AllowOverride all
			Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

Then, compile for the both as3 and js targets (run "haxe build_js.hxml" and "haxe build_as3.hxml").	
	
Finally open a browser on http://127.0.0.1/slplayer/demo/discover_slplayer/index.html
