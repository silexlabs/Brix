This project is under development. 

SLPlayer is an open source application development framework.
It provides ready-to-use components to build applications faster and easier.
It is using HTML/CSS & HaxeJS, which is close to JavaScript but strictly typed and easier to maintain.
It provides a robust development workflow thanks to HTML validation, components’ modularity, and existing IDEs.

SLPlayer is an alternative to Flex based on HTML/CSS web standards.

SLPlayer is compatible with Cocktail, which provides cross-platform compilation and can output native and web applications.
