The SLPlayer framework is the open source framework used to produce graphical user interfaces and digital publications. It links your HTML pages to a set of Haxe/javascript components. The components are made to be extended and skinned with CSS. The framework lets you develop robust and reusable components and javascript applications. 

The SLPlayer framework is compatible with Cocktail and NME Haxe libraries, so it can output native applications, javascript/HTML5 web apps, and Flash interactive applications.
