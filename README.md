Brix is an HTML5, CSS3 and Haxe JS based application framework.

It provides ready-to-use components to build applications faster.
It injects components into your HTML pages to make a Rich UI application out of it.
The set of Brix components are aggregable, extendable and skinnable with CSS.

Brix is an alternative to Flex based on HTML/CSS web standards.

What Brix brings to your workflow:

Easier and faster development:
- build applications out of HTML/CSS pages,
- industrialize application development by reusing existing components and skins,
- integration with existing IDEs as it's based on standard technologies: HTML5, CSS3 and Haxe,

Robustness:
- Brix components are written with Haxe JS which is - contrary to javascript - strictly typed,
- compilation of HTML and CSS source files (syntax checking, ...),

Performance:
- better performances with the compile time components feature.

Brix is compatible with the <a href="http://www.silexlabs.org/groups/labs/cocktail/">Cocktail</a> and NME Haxe libraries so it can also be compiled to native applications (Android, iOS, desktop) and AIR/Flash applications. Also, a Brix application compiled to HTML5/CSS3/javascript is compatible with PhoneGap.
