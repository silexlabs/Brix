/**
 * Any PlayerControl component should implement and be "using org.slplayer.component.player.PlayerControl" to be compliant with
 * Playable components.
 * 
 * The goal of the Playable/PlayerControl contracts is to allow having highly reusable micro components 
 * able to switch together in order to form a customized Player component. A Player control bar could thus be 
 * used for a galery (image player) as well as for a video player or any player-like component.
 * 
 * The PlayerControl contract is part of the contract that sends the player control commands. For example, in a 
 * case of a simple Gallery with a simple control bar (play/pause/previous/next), the Image part would be the 
 * Playable part while the control bar the PlayerControl part.
 * 
 * This contract is for the moment a draft as no Player components has been released yet in the slplayer distribution.
