/**
 * The Translator component is a global component that can translate your application content in 
 * as many languages as translation data you'll give him.
 * 
 * The default behavior of the Translator is based on the standard lang attribute of HTML elements.
 * If you use this attribute on an HTML element, it must reflect the actual language it contains. For 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 	<html lang="en">
 * 		<head>
 * 			<title>Title in English</title>
 * 			<script data-brix-use="brix.component.internationalization.Translator" data-location="lang/fr.xlf" data-format="xliff"></script>
 * 		</head>
 *		<body>
 * 			<div lang="la">
 * 				<!-- Contents here, eg TextNodes, must be in the latin language -->
 * 			</div>
 * 			<div>
 * 				<!-- Contents here, eg TextNodes, must be in the english language -->
 * 			</div>
 * 		</body>
 * 	</html>
 * 
 * In this example, the Translator knows only the english and french languages (contained in fr.xlf).
 * If the Translator.translate( *<html> node* , "fr" ) method is called, it will translate only the 
 * english contents it knows to the french contents it knows. The node with lang="la" will remain 
 * unchanged as the translator hasn't been given the latin translation data. Also, once translated to
 * french, the lang attributes that were set to "en" will be set to "fr".
 * 
 * This behavior allows you to work on your HTML source file directly with the message strings of a 
 * specific language.
 * 
 * But you can also optionally work on your HTML source file with message ids if you specify the option 
 * data-use-message-ids. In that case, on application startup, the Translator will translate the application 
 * to the default language (either the one specified by the lang attribute, or if not present, the default
 * one from user environment). Then, the runtime behavior after application startup is the same as previously.
 * This option is just a ease of use for those who prefer to work on application sources with message ids.
 * 
 * SETUP STEPS
 * 
 * Simply declare the component in your source HTML headers and specify the data-location (where are 
 * your translation data) and data-format (what is their format) attributes.
 * 
 * The data-location attribute must specify the path (or URL) to the language files (not folder).
 * If several files are used, separate them by commas.
 * 
 * The data-format attribute specify in which format are these files (currently supported format are Xliff and Ini).
 * Set it to "Ini" or "Xliff" (case insensitive).
 * 
 * If you want your HTML source file to contain message ids instead of message strings, set the data-use-message-ids 
 * attribute to "true". Else, do not specify it.
 * 
 * If you work on your sources with message strings, specify the lang attribute on your HTML elements to the 
 * corresponding language it contains. ie: if you use english message strings and that you have given a 
 * translation data file for the "en" locale, set lang="en" on the <html> root node. All child nodes will inherit 
 * then of this value but can also override it by specifying again this attribute to another value.
 * 
 * To call the translator at runtime, you then need another component or script to call it (see the 
 * /cmp/internationalization/translator/ use case for that).
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * Note: The Translator component current version is a draft. It may evolve a lot in a near future. It should
 * however cover most of your basic translation needs for your application. Thank you to report any bug 
 * in the Brix GitHub bug issue tracker and any RFE or suggestion in the Brix forum on silexlabs.org

	/**
	 * TODO
	 * To determine the language of a node, user agents must look at the nearest ancestor element (including the element itself if the node is an element) 
	 * that has a lang attribute in the XML namespace set or is an HTML element and has a lang in no namespace attribute set. That attribute specifies the 
	 * language of the node (regardless of its value).
	 * If both the lang attribute in no namespace and the lang attribute in the XML namespace are set on an element, user agents must use the lang attribute 
	 * in the XML namespace, and the lang attribute in no namespace must be ignored for the purposes of determining the element's language.
	 * If neither the node nor any of the node's ancestors, including the root element, have either attribute set, but there is a pragma-set default language 
	 * set, then that is the language of the node. If there is no pragma-set default language set, then language information from a higher-level protocol 
	 * (such as HTTP), if any, must be used as the final fallback language instead. In the absence of any such language information, and in cases where the 
	 * higher-level protocol reports multiple languages, the language of the node is unknown, and the corresponding language tag is the empty string.
	 * If the resulting value is not a recognized language tag, then it must be treated as an unknown language having the given language tag, distinct from 
	 * all other languages. For the purposes of round-tripping or communicating with other services that expect language tags, user agents should pass unknown 
	 * language tags through unmodified.
	 * Thus, for instance, an element with lang="xyzzy" would be matched by the selector :lang(xyzzy) (e.g. in CSS), but it would not be matched by :lang(abcde), 
	 * even though both are equally invalid. Similarly, if a Web browser and screen reader working in unison communicated about the language of the element, the 
	 * browser would tell the screen reader that the language was "xyzzy", even if it knew it was invalid, just in case the screen reader actually supported a 
	 * language with that tag after all.
	 * If the resulting value is the empty string, then it must be interpreted as meaning that the language of the node is explicitly unknown.
	 * User agents may use the element's language to determine proper processing or rendering (e.g. in the selection of appropriate fonts or pronunciations, 
	 * for dictionary selection, or for the user interfaces of form controls such as date pickers).
	 * The lang IDL attribute must reflect the lang content attribute in no namespace.
